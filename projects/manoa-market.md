## Project Goal

Whenever the semester is coming to an end you have an influx of students either finishing up, or going home for the break.  A lot of their belongings would be a hassle to take back.  With Manoa Market, the students would have a known platform where they can list these items up to be sold or traded.  Incoming students can take a look at the current items, to see if there are any items they could use/buy on there they would've otherwise bought new, helping Reduce and Reuse.

## Contributions

For this project I mainly dealt with the creation of the collections for the listings and what they entail.  I worked on the pages where you could insert or add an item to be on the market.  This also coincided with pages that would filter and show the different categories of the items available.

## Takeaways

This was my first time using the Agile method of developing software.  Working with a team like this with and using a scrum board helped me better prepare for the what it would be like developing software in the real world.
