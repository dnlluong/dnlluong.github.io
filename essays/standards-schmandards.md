## Coding procedure
When you start to code you mimic the tutorials or people that you learned from.  You don't really question it you kind of just do.  I know when I started, it was normal to use the curly brackets for functions like this, or at least the class I was learning in.
```
functionName()
{
code here
}
```
Nowadays everyone puts the bracket right after the parenthesis such as 
```
functionName() {
code here
}
```
Yea in a sense it doesn't really matter, but if you add up a lot of things you don't really matter, it might end up mattering in the end, value-wise.  If you slowly make small positive changes the overall change might be drastic.


## Thinking about readability
Only towards the end of my tenure at the University did I really think about coding.  A professor got me thinking about function names and variables for readability.  Naming them in such a way that you would probably need very few comments and have the person reading them still able to understand what is going on and what stands for what.  

## Using EsLint
The first time I used Eslint on code that I wrote it made me realize how much errors, while still compilable and runnable,  I have in my code.  Yea, some things I thought we're too nitpicky, such as spaces in certain areas.  Overtime I wasn't making much some of the same errors as I did before.  Thinking about it now, yea my code does look a bit cleaner.
