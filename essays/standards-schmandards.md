## Do we think how we ask questions?

When I ask a question do I really think how I ask the question.  Most of the times, not really.  I just ask the question the best I can to be able to get a response to a question.  When I actually think about how I ask questions, I do realize there could be better ways and worse ways than the things I already do.  People are willing to help if you ask, to have respect for their time, we should try make their time helping us the shortest and easiest that we possibly can.  We can do this be asking smarter questions, Smart Questions.
