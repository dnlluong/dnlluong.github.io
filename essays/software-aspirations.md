*Theres no finish line when it comes to learning software engineering.*

When I was kid I loved using the Computer, the internet was new then, we couldn't talk on the phone at the same time we used it, and download speeds were abysmal compared to nowadays.  I can't recount the number of viruses I ladened our computer with in my younger days.  Computers, the internet, everything was so cool.  I always wondered how programs and the computers worked.  My unofficial delve into learning things was just googling things.  Just learning a bit about each programming language and even putting together my own computer, but nothing really official.  Only when I went to University, to Manoa, did I officially go into that discipline.

## Starting University
When you first get that "Hello World" to print, that feeling is amazing.  I get that all the time when I learn something for the first time and put it to use, and it ends up compiling and working.

##After Uni
In uni I learned most of the basics, enough to try and pursue a career in the Software Engineering field I desire.  Theres so much more I could learn though, different specialties that I could try to pursue.  I don't want to become a Full-Stack Developer, per say, but I do wan't to have all the tools to be able to become a Full-Stack Developer.  I want to be able to have an idea in my head, and be able to create it myself from scratch.  

I came a long way from where I started but I'm still very far from where I want to be.
