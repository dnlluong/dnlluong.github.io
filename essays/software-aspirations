*Theres no finish line when it comes to learning software engineering.*

When I was kid I loved using the Computer, the internet was new then, we couldn't talk on the phone at the same time we used it, and download speeds were abysmal compared to nowadays.  I can't recount the number of viruses I ladened our computer with in my younger days.  Computers, the internet, everything was so cool.  I always wondered how programs and the computers worked.  My unofficial delve into learning things was just googling things.  Just learning a bit about each programming language and even putting together my own computer, but nothing really official.  Only when I went to University, to Manoa, did I officially go into that discipline.

## Starting University

In uni I learned most of the basics, enough to try and pursue a career in the Software Engineering field I desire.  

I came a long way from where I started but I'm still very far from where I want to be.  

## After Uni
## Okay!

So back to the original premise; why is being one of the club officers so difficult?

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
