HTML is easy, yes.  CSS is easy, yes.  Creating things from HTML and CSS that look amazing is not easy.  You might need a specific layout that you would need to keep trial and erroring to figure out.  If you're trying to recreate something things might be a little off.  Maybe a little off centered, or too much padding from the top, and you have to adjust for those values.

Without learning the basics, actually you should learn a lot more than the basics, then you won't really know what the frameworks are doing that allow them to make your time easier.  You don't have to know exactly tit-for-tat what the frameworks are doing
