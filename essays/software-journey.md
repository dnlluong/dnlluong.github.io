## If you think you know, you don't

I, like others in my position, think they know a fair amount of knowledge as they prepare to graduate.  I've worked with many algorithms and learned about the different ways to go about and solve them.  Certain Strategies that might be better to use in one situation than other.  Though this was the first time I've encountered functional programming.

When you think of coding, it's probably like this, imperative.

```
const numList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
let result = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < numList.length; i++) {
  if (numList[i] % 2 === 0) {
    result += numList[i] * 10;
  }
}
```
